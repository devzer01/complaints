	Complaints Business Bulletin Board was founded in 2009 by a group of consumer activist that decided to provide an 
	unfiltered venue for consumer voice. Since then we have been activley working on maintaining the stage on an ongoing basis. 
	We have received threats from many law firms to shut down certain content on our site. However we have remain calm and professional 
	and taking the consumers side 100% of the time. This behaviour had resulted us for having our data center shutdown in multiple occasions 
	with downtime occured.
